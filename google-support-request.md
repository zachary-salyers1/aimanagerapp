**Subject: Storage Rule Firestore `get()` Fails Despite `Cloud Datastore User` Role on Service Agent**

**Body:**

Dear Google Cloud Support Team,

I am experiencing an issue with Firebase Storage security rules that require reading data from Cloud Firestore within the same project. Uploads are failing with `storage/unauthorized` when the rule performs a `get()` operation on Firestore, even after apparently granting the necessary permissions.

**Project ID:** `able-armor-458920-p1`
**Project Number:** `1031931869885`

**Goal:**
Enforce Firebase Storage security rules allowing writes only if the user owns the corresponding project document in Firestore. The intended secure rule is:
```
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /projects/{projectId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null &&
                   get(/databases/(default)/documents/projects/$(projectId)).data.ownerId == request.auth.uid;
    }
  }
}
```

**Problem:**
Uploads using this secure rule fail with `storage/unauthorized`. The specific error occurs when trying to upload to paths like `projects/uER3eBfbfSQKyEwKnqVC/general/...`.

**Troubleshooting Steps Taken:**

1.  **Verified Secure Rule Failure:** Confirmed uploads fail with the secure rule but succeed with a temporary permissive rule (`allow write: if request.auth != null;`), isolating the issue to the Firestore `get()` check.
2.  **Verified Data:** Confirmed the target Firestore document (`projects/uER3eBfbfSQKyEwKnqVC`) exists, uses the `(default)` database, and its `ownerId` field (`ajgOZrO41vcHBiId0EY7qNC6Kce2`) correctly matches the UID of the authenticated user making the upload request.
3.  **Verified APIs:** Confirmed the `Identity and Access Management (IAM) API`, `Cloud Storage API`, and `Cloud Firestore API` are enabled for the project.
4.  **Identified Service Agent:** Determined the expected Storage Service Agent principal is `service-1031931869885@gcp-sa-firebasestorage.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
5.  **Attempted to Find Agent via UI/CLI:** This service agent was **not initially visible** in the Cloud Console IAM list (even with "Include Google-provided role grants" checked) and `gcloud iam service-accounts list` returned "Listed 0 items.". *(This lack of visibility might be a related symptom)*.
6.  **Granted Role via CLI:** Despite the visibility issue, successfully granted the required role using the `gcloud` CLI command:
    ```bash
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding able-armor-458920-p1 --member="serviceAccount:service-1031931869885@gcp-sa-firebasestorage.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role="roles/datastore.user"
    ```
    *(The command completed successfully, implying the service account does exist despite not being listed).*
7.  **Allowed Propagation Time:** Waited significantly longer than 10 minutes after granting the role via CLI.
8.  **Redeployed Rules:** Redeployed both Firestore and Storage rules multiple times after granting permissions.
9.  **Loosened Firestore Rules (Temporary):** Temporarily changed the Firestore rule for `match /projects/{projectId}` to `allow get: if request.auth != null;` to ensure the Firestore rule wasn't blocking the internal read. The Storage upload still failed with `storage/unauthorized`. (Firestore rules have been reverted).

**Current Status:**
Despite the `service-1031931869885@gcp-sa-firebasestorage.iam.gserviceaccount.com` service agent presumably having the `Cloud Datastore User` role (as added via `gcloud`), the secure Storage rule using `get(...)` continues to fail with `storage/unauthorized`.

**Request:**
Could you please investigate why the `get()` operation within the Firebase Storage security rule evaluation context is failing to read Firestore, even though the necessary IAM role appears to have been granted to the Storage Service Agent? Is there a potential issue with the provisioning of this service agent, its visibility in IAM, or the propagation/application of its permissions for cross-service rule checks?

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,
