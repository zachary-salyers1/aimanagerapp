## Purpose

Define the product requirements for a React-based project management application that enables users to create projects, manage tasks and associated documents, track time and expenses, and synchronize project files with Google Drive.

---

## Scope

- **In scope**:
    - User authentication and authorization via Firebase Auth
    - CRUD operations for projects and tasks
    - Document upload/management per task (via Firebase Storage)
    - Time‐entry and expense‐entry features (including receipt/invoice uploads)
    - Google Drive integration for project folder creation and file syncing
- **Out of scope** (for initial MVP):
    - Team‐collaboration features (multi‐user roles, permissions)
    - Advanced reporting or analytics dashboards
    - Offline support

---

## Objectives

1. **Centralize project data** – one place for tasks, docs, time entries, expenses
2. **Streamline document management** – attach files directly to tasks and have them mirrored in Drive
3. **Accurately track effort & costs** – ease of logging hours and expenses with receipts
4. **Leverage Firebase** – secure, scalable backend for data and file storage
5. **Automate Drive sync** – eliminate manual folder‐and‐file creation

---

## Target Users

- Freelancers and consultants managing multiple client engagements
- Small teams tracking deliverables, time, and budgets
- Project managers who need lightweight, integrated file syncing

---

## User Stories

1. **Project Creation**
    - “As a user, I want to create a new project so I can group related tasks.”
2. **Task Management**
    - “As a user, I want to add/edit/delete tasks within a project, so I can track work items.”
3. **Document Attachment**
    - “As a user, I want to upload documents (e.g., specs, contracts) to a task so all related files stay organized.”
4. **Time Tracking**
    - “As a user, I want to log hours against a project/task so I can monitor effort.”
5. **Expense Tracking**
    - “As a user, I want to record expenses and attach receipts so I can track project costs.”
6. **Drive Sync**
    - “As a user, when I create a project, a Google Drive folder is auto‐generated, and any documents I add are saved there too.”

## Functional Requirements

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Authentication** | Firebase Auth (email/password, Google SSO) |
| **Projects** | Create/Read/Update/Delete; store metadata in Firestore; include `driveFolderId` |
| **Tasks** | CRUD under a project; fields: title, description, status, due date; link to `projectId` |
| **Documents** | Upload via Firebase Storage; metadata in Firestore (name, storagePath, driveFileId, taskId) |
| **Time Entries** | Log date, hours, task/project association, userId; store in Firestore |
| **Expenses** | Log date, amount, description, receipt upload; metadata in Firestore (driveFileId optional) |
| **Google Drive Integration** | On project creation: call Drive API to make folder; on document upload: copy file to Drive folder |
| **Notifications (optional)** | Email or in‐app alerts for key events (e.g., new task assigned) |

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: page load < 1 s for key views; Firestore queries paginated
- **Security**:
    - Firebase Security Rules to isolate data per user
    - OAuth scopes limited to Drive folder access
- **Scalability**: support up to thousands of projects and files
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime, retry logic on Drive API failures
- **Usability**: intuitive UI with minimal clicks for core flows

## Technical Architecture

```
┌──────────┐       ┌───────────────┐       ┌─────────┐
│   React  │ <-->  │ Firebase Auth │       │ Google  │
│ frontend │       ├───────────────┤       │  Drive  │
│  (SPA)   │       │ Firestore     │       │  API    │
└──────────┘       └───────────────┘       └─────────┘
        │                ↑  │
        │                │  └─ Cloud Function for Drive sync
        └─ Firebase Storage

```

- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Context API (or Redux)
- **Backend**:
    - Firebase Auth (user management)
    - Firestore (real-time NoSQL database)
    - Storage (file uploads)
    - Cloud Functions (to handle Drive folder creation and file mirroring)
- **Integration**: Google Drive REST API via a service account or OAuth2

---

## Data Model (Firestore Collections)

```markdown
projects/
  {projectId}: { name, description, createdAt, ownerId, driveFolderId }

tasks/
  {taskId}: { projectId, title, description, status, dueDate }

documents/
  {docId}: { taskId, name, storagePath, uploadedAt, driveFileId }

timeEntries/
  {entryId}: { projectId, taskId, userId, date, hours }

expenses/
  {expenseId}: { projectId, amount, date, description, receiptPath, driveFileId }

```

---

## UI/UX Overview

1. **Dashboard**: list of projects with summary cards (tasks pending, hours logged, expenses)
2. **Project Detail**:
    - Header: project name, “Open in Drive” link
    - Tabs: Tasks | Documents | Time & Expenses
3. **Task List**: CRUD operations; drag-and-drop to reorder (optional)
4. **Document Viewer**: file upload dialog; list with “Download” and “View in Drive”
5. **Time & Expense Center**: forms to add entries; table view with filters (date range)

---

## Milestones & Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Setup & Auth** | 1 week | React boilerplate; Firebase integration; login flow |
| **2. Project CRUD** | 1 week | Project list and creation UI; Firestore rules |
| **3. Task Management** | 2 weeks | Task CRUD, UI/UX polish |
| **4. Doc Upload & Storage** | 2 weeks | Firebase Storage upload; task-doc linking |
| **5. Time & Expense** | 2 weeks | Forms and tables for hours/expenses |
| **6. Drive Sync Integration** | 1 week | Cloud Function for folder/file sync |
| **7. Testing & Launch** | 1 week | End-to-end QA; user guide; deploy |

---

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: 100 projects created in first month
- **Engagement**: average 5 tasks per project; 10 time entries per project
- **Reliability**: < 1% error rate on file uploads or Drive sync
- **Performance**: 90th percentile page load < 800 ms

---

## Risks & Dependencies

- **Google Drive API quotas** may throttle sync operations
- **Firebase costs** could rise with large file volumes
- **OAuth complexity** for Drive access requires careful security review
- **Cross-origin issues** when invoking cloud functions from React
